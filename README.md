## Object-oriented-javascript

"Everything in JS is an Object"

* Objects in Javascript are like objects in real life
* They have properties and things they can do

- We can access object properties using the dot notation or using [square brackets]
- we use square brackets when the prop is mutable

*Classes*
- Classes in JS are like blueprints
- convention dictates that class names should start with a capital letter e.g class User {};
  
  the 'new' keyword
  - creates a new empty object {}
  - sets a valus of 'this' to be the new empty object
  - calls the constructor method

  method chaining
  - when we return this; inside the methods, we can chain methods

*Prototype*
- every object type has a prototype
- prototype is like a map for the object type
- __proto__ points to the prototype of the object
-
